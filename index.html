            <h1 class="title"> The Life of PAUL WALKER</h1>
            <p>
                Paul Walker was an American actor. Walker began his career guest-starring in several television shows such as The Young and the Restless (1973) (1993) and Touched by an Angel (1994). Walker gained prominence with breakout roles in coming of age and teen films such as She's All That and Varsity Blues. In 2001, Walker gained international fame for his portrayal of Brian O'Conner in the street racing action film The Fast and the Furious (2001), and would reprise the role in five of the next six installments. He also starred in films such as Eight Below, Timeline, Into the Blue, Joy Ride and Running Scared.

Besides acting, Walker was the face of The Coty Prestige fragrance brand Davidoff Cool Water for Men, and starred in the National Geographic Channel series, Expedition Great White. He also founded the charity "Reach Out Worldwide" (ROWW), an organization providing relief efforts for areas affected by natural disasters. He was often praised for his off-screen charity work, and as a performer.

Walker died in a single-vehicle collision on November 30, 2013, alongside friend Roger Rodas. Three films that he was involved in at the time were released posthumously: Hours (2013), Brick Mansions (2014) and Furious 7 (2015). The song, "See You Again", by Wiz Khalifa, which appeared on the Furious 7 soundtrack, is a tribute to Walker. The song was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.
